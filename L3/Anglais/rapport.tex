        \subsection{Game Description}
            \paragraph{}
                \textbf{New Chess 2\textsuperscript{TM} : Board Game Boogaloo} is a new way of playing Chess by mixing it with other traditional board games like Cards, UNO, Dices and Poker.
            \paragraph{}
                The goal of \textbf{New Chess 2\textsuperscript{TM} : Board Game Boogaloo} is to win a regular game of chess by capturing your opponent's master piece, but with a twist. You can alter the course of the game by playing special cards, taking risky but possibly rewarding bets, and much more.
        \subsection{Game Rules}
            \paragraph{Setup :\\}
                First, setup a traditional $8\times8$ chessboard, as shown in the picture below. Then shuffle all the cards and place them next to the chessboard, accessible to both players, and don't forget to leave an empty space next to the draw pile for the discard pile. Each player draws 5 cards and the game can begin.
            \paragraph{}

            \paragraph{Choosing the 1\textsuperscript{st} player :\\}
                Play a best-of-3 game of rock-paper-scissors. The winner decides which player gets to start the game.
            \paragraph{Beginning of a turn :\\}
                At the start of each turn, the player can chose to gamble by choosing "Odd" or "Even", then rolling 5 dices. If they land 3 or more numbers of the chosen type, they can move 2 pieces during their turn instead of 1 (or move the same piece twice). Otherwise, they don't get to play this turn and move on to the next player.
