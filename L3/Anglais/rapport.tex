        \subsection{Abdenour}
            \textbf{Product designer and marketing ops.}
            \\ He takes care of the overall product user experience and is responsible for the players' satisfaction. So for example, if a player has trouble understanding the game's rules, he has to modify them to make them more explicit. He is always testing new ideas, prototyping potential better user experiences, measuring players satisfaction through their feedbacks, analyzing data about players during live experiments with volunteers (how well players perform against regular chess, is it more beginner-friendly, ...). He is also part-time involved into marketing operations, trying to make the game go viral via YouTube sponsorships and Twitch streamings.
            
        \subsection{Pierre}
            \textbf{Game designer and programmer.}
            \\He imagined the game rules, has previous experiences with numerous games and video games, so he can come up with lots of new ideas, re-inventing the chess board game.
            He develops the mobile version of the game, and is in charge of everything related to programming. Every time a bug occurs, he is here to fix it, and he also adds new features like an online scoreboard and the ability to save and share replays among players. Moreover, he conceives the cards, match their colors through the design he thinks, in order not to impair chess original style.

        \subsection{Game Description}
            \paragraph{}
                \textbf{New Chess 2\textsuperscript{TM} : Board Game Boogaloo} is a new way of playing Chess by mixing it with other traditional board games like Cards, UNO, Dices and Poker.
            \paragraph{}
                The goal of \textbf{New Chess 2\textsuperscript{TM} : Board Game Boogaloo} is to win a regular game of chess by capturing your opponent's master piece, but with a twist. You can alter the course of the game by playing special cards, taking risky but possibly rewarding bets, and much more.
        \subsection{Game Rules}
            \paragraph{Setup :\\}
                First, setup a traditional $8\times8$ chessboard, as shown in the picture below. Then shuffle all the cards and place them next to the chessboard, accessible to both players, and don't forget to leave an empty space next to the draw pile for the discard pile. Each player draws 5 cards and the game can begin.
            \paragraph{}
                \centerline{TODO : INSERT INITIAL SETUP DIAGRAM}
            \paragraph{Choosing the 1\textsuperscript{st} player :\\}
                Play a best-of-3 game of rock-paper-scissors. The winner decides which player gets to start the game.
            \paragraph{Beginning of a turn :\\}
                At the start of each turn, the player can chose to gamble by choosing "Odd" or "Even", then rolling 5 dices. If they land 3 or more numbers of the chosen type, they can move 2 pieces during their turn instead of 1 (or move the same piece twice). Otherwise, they don't get to play this turn and move on to the next player.
            \paragraph{Possible actions :\\}
